We make finding a library seat simple and quick, so you can spend more time studying and less time searching. To create a campus where every student can make the most of their time.

We realized that our university library was overflowing during midterms and it took 20-30 minutes to walk around looking for an open seat. So, we built an Instagram account (@moffittstatus) posting hourly updates of how busy each floor is, so students can skip the busy floors and go straight to open seats. Responses were phenomenal, with 95% of students saying we helped them save time. After proving the concept (see screenshots below), we began building moffitstatus.io. 

The project below is v1, with many improvements to come. To run it, make sure you have next.js and react packages installed.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
